This directory contains all necessary files to go from the corrected version of the DeepSea file list to
a directory of bedfiles used. The initial DeepSea xlsx file missed the first file used and present in 
further tables in the paper supplements. I have added the file wgEncodeAwgDnaseDuke8988tUniPk.narrowPeak.gz 
as the first line, removed the header row and turned xlsx into csv for convenience.
